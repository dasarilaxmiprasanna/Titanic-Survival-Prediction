This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare. The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. A machine learning classification model is trained and evaluated to analyze survival patterns and prediction accuracy.
